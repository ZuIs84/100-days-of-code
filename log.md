# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2024-05-27 Monday (Spring Bank Holiday in UK)

**Today's Progress**: Today compeleted Days 12 and Day 13 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy

**Thoughts:** I worked fast through this and there are things to be improved on the blackjack game, however I wanted to proceed regardless as was excited to see what Day 14 had to offer.

### Day 1: 2024-05-28 Tuesday
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**:  I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 10: 2024-06-06 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

05:10 BST - I was awake in bed before 4.30am, but didn't get out until I heard the alarm. Hayfever has come down on me very hard since yesterday and plagued me since then till now. So my eyes are constantly filled with tears, my nose is runny and my breathing is hampered a little. Yet, I still get that exciting feeling when I boot up PyCharm IDE to get started.
05:44 BST - Completed Day 24 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy

06:11 BST - Day 25 is to learn how to use Pandas and make something like this https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states

08:22 BST - Finished work learning how to manipulate squirrel data

09:00 BST - Stopped work, I didn't start the final task of Day 25 which is the US States Game. So instead I just went through Days 2, 3 and 4 of the Replit 100 Days of Code challenge @ https://join.replit.com/python

**Thoughts** I am very very excited about working with Python Panda and venturing into the world of Data Science. 
Apart from that, I realised I have not been as productive and efficiently focused on my work in recent mornings. I realised this morning that I did not take any breaks. This hampered my progress as over time I was going through things more slowly and getting stuck on things that I perhaps could have overcome better after a short break to refresh myself and have a look at my coding again with fresh eyes.
So I intend to make sure I try to prime myself the morning before, by having a bit more of a plan on how I will spend my mornings, rather than just wake up and get started and work it out as I go along. I think I need to force myself to have 5 minute breaks after each 30min session. As well as to have a brief look over the work I am expected to do also.

**Notes** 1. Read Donald Knuth book "The Art of Computer Programming" - Angela says to focus on readability and make it easy for fellow coders to understand, rather than efficiency at the start.
