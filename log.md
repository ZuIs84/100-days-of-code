05:10 BST - I was awake in bed before 4.30am, but didn't get out until I heard the alarm. Hayfever has come down on me very hard since yesterday and plagued me since then till now. So my eyes are constantly filled with tears, my nose is runny and my breathing is hampered a little. Yet, I still get that exciting feeling when I boot up PyCharm IDE to get started.
