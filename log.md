# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2024-05-27 Monday (Spring Bank Holiday in UK)

**Today's Progress**: Today compeleted Days 12 and Day 13 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

05:10 BST - I was awake in bed before 4.30am, but didn't get out until I heard the alarm. Hayfever has come down on me very hard since yesterday and plagued me since then till now. So my eyes are constantly filled with tears, my nose is runny and my breathing is hampered a little. Yet, I still get that exciting feeling when I boot up PyCharm IDE to get started.
05:44 BST - Completed Day 24 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy

06:11 BST - Day 25 is to learn how to use Pandas and make something like this https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states

08:22 BST - Finished work learning how to manipulate squirrel data

09:00 BST - Stopped work, I didn't start the final task of Day 25 which is the US States Game. So instead I just went through Days 2, 3 and 4 of the Replit 100 Days of Code challenge @ https://join.replit.com/python

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Notes** 1. Read Donald Knuth book "The Art of Computer Programming" - Angela says to focus on readability and make it easy for fellow coders to understand, rather than efficiency at the start.
