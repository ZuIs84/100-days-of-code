# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2024-05-27 Monday (Spring Bank Holiday in UK)

**Today's Progress**: Today compeleted Days 12 and Day 13 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy. I also got distracted perhaps by discovering [CodIngame](https://www.codingame.com/)

**Thoughts:** I worked fast through this and there are things to be improved on the blackjack game, however I wanted to proceed regardless as was excited to see what Day 14 had to offer.

### Day 2: 2024-05-29 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 10: 2024-06-06 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

05:10 BST - I was awake in bed before 4.30am, but didn't get out until I heard the alarm. Hayfever has come down on me very hard since yesterday and plagued me since then till now. So my eyes are constantly filled with tears, my nose is runny and my breathing is hampered a little. Yet, I still get that exciting feeling when I boot up PyCharm IDE to get started.
05:44 BST - Completed Day 24 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy

06:11 BST - Day 25 is to learn how to use Pandas and make something like this https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states

08:22 BST - Finished work learning how to manipulate squirrel data

09:00 BST - Stopped work, I didn't start the final task of Day 25 which is the US States Game. So instead I just went through Days 2, 3 and 4 of the Replit 100 Days of Code challenge @ https://join.replit.com/python

**Thoughts** I am very very excited about working with Python Panda and venturing into the world of Data Science. 
Apart from that, I realised I have not been as productive and efficiently focused on my work in recent mornings. I realised this morning that I did not take any breaks. This hampered my progress as over time I was going through things more slowly and getting stuck on things that I perhaps could have overcome better after a short break to refresh myself and have a look at my coding again with fresh eyes.
So I intend to make sure I try to prime myself the morning before, by having a bit more of a plan on how I will spend my mornings, rather than just wake up and get started and work it out as I go along. I think I need to force myself to have 5 minute breaks after each 30min session. As well as to have a brief look over the work I am expected to do also.

**Notes** 1. Read Donald Knuth book "The Art of Computer Programming" - Angela says to focus on readability and make it easy for fellow coders to understand, rather than efficiency at the start.

### Day 11: 2024-06-07 Friday 

**Today's Progress**: 

04:00 BST woke up nice.

04:30 BST started work on the US States Game, from Day 25 of Angela Yu's Python course on Udemy. I ensured I had a break after about 30min intervals.

07:30 BST Completed Day 25! See links below to see work.

08:38 BST Got distracted in a break. Found this cool site called [profileme.dev](https://www.profileme.dev/) from a guy called Daniel Cranney on [Twitter](https://x.com/danielcranney). I've used it for myself and you can see the results at my own [profile](https://github.com/ZuIs84). It's okay, I usually stop working at 9am. Instead, I'm going to give myself a 30mins break and then charge on for extra time into 10am to get Day 26 complete.




**Thoughts:** I worked fast through this and there are things to be improved on the blackjack game, however I wanted to proceed regardless as was excited to see what Day 14 had to offer.
I realise I should look to how to extend each program that I complete during this challenge. So for instance, after completing this US States Game, I could easily create one for the oceans and continents of the world, then the same for any map I can get my hands on. I would like to create one for all the counties of UK.

Found out why I was not able to make executable files with pyinstaller. I ran into this when trying to make one from the update snake_game which now has a high score feature. The answer was found here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70227771/i-cant-use-pyinstaller. But now I have a new problem, the exe. file crashes. This could be due to file handling, which the previous snake and pong games did not have.
